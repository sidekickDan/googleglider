I needed to create some custom javascript code to work with Google App Scripts used in Google Sheets...this came in handy when connecting some of my sheets to external services to appify things on mobile devices such as GlideApps and AppSheet...
These handy js functions come in handy when c.r.u.d'ing records using services like the ones above or just for fun :)
Enjoy these sample code i created and/or aggregated, morphed or frankensteined into something useful ...
